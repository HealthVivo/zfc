\title{Algorithm}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The ZFC analysis algorithm adopts the z-score of log2 fold change as
the judgement of the sgRNA and gene changes between reference group
(without treatment) and experiment group (with treatment). ZFC
supports screening with iBAR \citep{zhu_guide_2019} employed, as
well as conventional screening with replicates. The sgRNA with
replicates and sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is treated with similar procedure.

\section{Normalization of raw counts}

We use total counts for the normalization of raw counts, to rectify
the batch sequencing deptch. Because some sgRNAs in the reference have
very low raw counts, which can affect the fold change calculation of
the following analysis. We define sgRNAs counts less than 0.05
quantile both in reference group and experiment group as the small
count sgRNAs. The mean counts of all the small count sgNRAs were added
to the normalized counts. The normalized counts is calculated as
following expression:

$$Cn_{i} = \frac{Cr_{i}}{S_{ref}} \times 0.5 \times (S_{ref} + S_{exp})$$

$$C_{i} = Cn_{i} + Cm_{small}$$

where, $Cn_{i}$ is the normalized count of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in
reference group, $Cr_{i}$ is the raw count of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$,
$Cm_{small}$ is the mean counts of all the small count sgRNAs,
$S_{ref}$ is the sum of raw counts of all the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in
reference group, $S_{exp}$ is the sum of raw counts of all the
sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in experiment group, $C_{i}$ is the final normalized
counts for ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ after small count adjustment.


\section{Calculate fold change}

The raw fold change of each sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is calculated from the
normalized counts of reference and experiment groups.

$$fc_{i} = \frac{Cref_{i}}{Cexp_{i}}$$
$$lfc_{i} = \log_{2}fc_{i}$$

where, $fc_{i}$ is the fold change (FC) of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ and
$lfc_{i}$ is the log2 fold change (LFC) of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$,
$Cref_{i}$ and $Cexp_{i}$ are the normalized counts of reference
and experiment groups respectively.

\section{Calculate fold change standard deviation}

In order to calculate z-score of LFC (ZLFC), the standard deviation of
LFC should be calculated. The LFC of sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is related to the
normalized counts of reference group. So the standard deviations of
LFC are different for sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s with different normalized counts of
reference group. All the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s are divided into several sets
according to the normalized counts of reference group. And the
standard deviations of log fold change are calculated among the
divided sets. The LFC standard diviation and the normalized counts of
the reference is linearly related. So, linear model is calculated for
the LFC sd and reference counts. And the linear model is used to
calculate the LFC standard diviation for all the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$.

\section{Raw z score of log fold change}

The raw z score of log fold change is calculated.

$$raw ZLFC = \frac{LFC}/{LFC std}$$

\section{Modify sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ ZLFC with large leverage}

The leverage of the Raw ZLFC of sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ to the sgRNA mean ZLFC is
calcualted to distinguish the possible free-rider
sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s. sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s raw ZLFC with leverage larger than the
threshold is modified.

$$Leverage_{i} = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_{k} - \={x})^{2}}{\sum_{k}^{n}(x_{k} - \={x})^{2}}$$

where `$Leverage_{i}$` is the `$i$th` sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ for one sgRNA, `$n$`
is the number of sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s for the sgRNA, `$\={x}$` is the mean of
the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s' raw ZLFC.

In order to modify the high leverage sgRNA$^{iBAR}$, we calculated the
modification ratio by the leverage.

$$Leverage Ratio_{i} = n \times \frac{2 - Leverage_{i}}{2 * n - 2}$$

The raw ZLFC of one sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is multiplied by the ratio to generate
the modified ZLFC.


\section{Calculate zscore of fold change p value in normal distribution}

Calculate sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ ZLFC p value from normal distribution.


\section{Calculate gene mean zscore of fold change}

The gene level ZLFCs are calculated as the mean of all the ZLFCs of
the relevant sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s. Empirical P value is also calculated for the
gene ZLFCs.

\section{Robust rank aggregation analysis}


Robust rank aggregation \citep{kolde_robust_2012} is utilized to
calculate the rank significance of the gene with the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s
in the whole library. Aside from robust rank aggregation, mean rank
aggregation is also calculated.
