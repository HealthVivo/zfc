\title{Algorithm}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The ZFC analysis algorithm adopts the z-score of log2 fold change as
the judgement of the sgRNA and gene changes between reference group
(without treatment) and experiment group (with treatment). ZFC
supports screening with iBAR \citep{zhu_guide_2019} employed, as
well as conventional screening with replicates. The sgRNA with
replicates and sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is treated with similar procedure.

\section{Normalization of raw counts}

We use total counts for the normalization of raw counts, to rectify
the batch sequencing deptch. Because some sgRNAs in the reference have
very low raw counts, which can affect the fold change calculation of
the following analysis. We define sgRNAs counts less than 0.05
quantile both in reference group and experiment group as the small
count sgRNAs. The mean counts of all the small count sgNRAs were added
to the normalized counts. The normalized counts is calculated as
following expression:

$$Cn_{i} = \frac{Cr_{i}}{S_{ref}} \times 0.5 \times (S_{ref} + S_{exp})$$

$$C_{i} = Cn_{i} + Cm_{small}$$

where, $Cn_{i}$ is the normalized count of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in
reference group, $Cr_{i}$ is the raw count of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$,
$Cm_{small}$ is the mean counts of all the small count sgRNAs,
$S_{ref}$ is the sum of raw counts of all the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in
reference group, $S_{exp}$ is the sum of raw counts of all the
sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ in experiment group, $C_{i}$ is the final normalized
counts for ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ after small count adjustment.


\section{Calculate fold change}

The raw fold change of each sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is calculated from the
normalized counts of reference and experiment groups.

$$fc_{i} = \frac{Cref_{i}}{Cexp_{i}}$$
$$lfc_{i} = \log_{2}fc_{i}$$

where, $fc_{i}$ is the fold change (FC) of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ and
$lfc_{i}$ is the log2 fold change (LFC) of ith sgRNA$^{iBAR}$,
$Cref_{i}$ and $Cexp_{i}$ are the normalized counts of reference
and experiment groups respectively.

\section{Calculate fold change standard deviation}

In order to calculate z-score of LFC (ZLFC), the standard deviation of
LFC should be calculated. The LFC of sgRNA$^{iBAR}$ is related to the
normalized counts of reference group. So the standard deviations of
LFC are different for sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s with different normalized counts
of reference group. All the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s are divided into several
sets according to the normalized counts of reference group. And the
standard deviations of log fold change are calculated among the
divided sets.

\section{Considering barcode direction}


iBAR\citep{zhu_guide_2019} acts as the internal replicates in
CRISPR library screening. The consistency of iBARs for one sgRNA
implies the confidence of the LFC of the sgRNA. For sgRNAs with
inconsistent barcodes fold change, the LFC might be affected by
free-rider effects or other reasons. So, the score of sgRNAs with
inconsistent sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s should be punished. Using z-score of LFC,
the adjustment of LFC standard deviations can be used as the
punishment. The larger the standard deviations, the smaller the
absolute values of LFC z-score. Punishment rate can be modified
according to library screening conditions. For positive screening,
free-rider being a significant problem, a large punishment rate should
be assigned. While for negative screening, smaller punishment rate is
appropriate.

$$std_{modified} = std_{sets} + std_{sgRNA} \times r$$

where $std_{modified}$ is the adjusted standard deviation of log
fold change for sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s with inconsistent LFC direction,
$std_{sets}$ is the raw standard deviation of the
sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s sets, $std_{sgRNA}$ is the standard deviation of log fold
change of all the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s for one sgRNA, $r$.

\section{Calculate zscore of fold change}


The modified standard deviations are used to calcualte the ZLFCs of
sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s. To be note, in the calculation of the ZLFC, the mean of
LFCs is not substracted from the LFCs.

$$ZLFC = \frac{LFC}{std_{modified}}$$


\section{Calculate gene mean zscore of fold change}

The gene level ZLFCs are calculated as the mean of all the ZLFCs of
the relevant sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s. Empirical P value is also calculated for the
gene ZLFCs.

\section{Robust rank aggregation analysis}


Robust rank aggregation \citep{kolde_robust_2012} is utilized to
calculate the rank significance of the gene with the sgRNA$^{iBAR}$s
in the whole library. Aside from robust rank aggregation, mean rank
aggregation is also calculated.
